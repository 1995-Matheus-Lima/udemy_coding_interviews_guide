What is an array? 
	for example, when we have write:
		int a; 
			we will get for bytes of memory space.
	but when we write:
		int a[16]
			we will get 16 box of for vytes of memory space

int a[n]
	start in 0
	end n-1
	all elementes should be of int type here
char a[10]
	all elementes should be of char type here

when we initialize a array, the rest of the position become zero
	a[10] = {1,2,3,4}
	a[10] is  [1,2,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]

when we dont initialize a any value of the array, the array will be complete with garbage value;
	a[10]
	a[10] is [12131,579876,765445678,765434,7876543,456789765,456787654,5676543,43,456]

when we use sizeof(d), here d is an array d[10],  we got the number of bytes

	we can't creat an array bigger then 10‚Åµ
